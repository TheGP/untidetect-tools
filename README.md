# Curated anti-detect tools list  
Just making a tools list for my project, feel free to send pull requests :) 
While looking around, it may be a good idea to sign up on all the Discord channels each product has to find some interesting insides from users.

Important: if you work on something related to undetection, like humanizing puppeteer actions, we may consider collaboration as I'm working currently on it too. My [TG](https://t.me/eugenebos).

# Anti-detect browsers
* [Undetectable](https://undetectable.io/?r=AXCFe) - 5 cloud profiles free, $49 for unlimited local with 25 "configs", 1 additional config $1 (API + driver automation)
* [ADBLogin](https://adblogin.com) - The First anti-detect browser free forever
* [NSTBrowser](https://app.nstbrowser.io/r/NZ0daY) - 10 profiles opened / day free, $299 for 3000 open profiles per day, quite new on the market.
* [Multilogin](https://multilogin.com/#a_aid=secretbonus3) - starts from €74 for 100 profiles  
* [Incogniton](https://incogniton.com/aff/620515/) - 10 free, $29.99/Month for 50
* [Octo Browser](https://octobrowser.net) - starts from €21 for 10  
* [Gologin](https://go.gologin.com/secretbonus-IFOGFRB) - 3 free, $24 for 100 profiles, no unlimited plan, free proxies  
* [AdsPower](https://share.adspower.net/YyHH9v) - 2 profiles free, $5.4 for 10 profiles, no unlimited plan  
* [Morelogin](https://www.morelogin.com/?from=AAA2qquLhqBd) - 2 free, $9 for 10 profiles and 2 users  
* [Dolphin-anty](https://dolphin-anty.com/a/3047556) - 10 free, $89 for 100  
* [Kameleo](https://kameleo.io/) - starts €59/user with unlimited profiles  
* [Vmlogin](https://www.vmlogin.us/) - $99 for 200 profiles  
* [Indigo](https://www.goindigo.in/) - €99 for 100 profiles  
* [GhostBrowser](https://ghostbrowser.com/) - 4 profiles free, $21 unlimited  
* [Bablosoft](https://bablosoft.com/shop/BrowserAutomationStudio) - free browser automation studio, for Puppeteer look at [puppeteer-with-fingerprints](https://github.com/CheshireCaat/puppeteer-with-fingerprints), the only browser as I know that supports faking canvas (with [PerfectCanvas](https://wiki.bablosoft.com/doku.php?id=perfectcanvas). If you need a code for your website to generate own canvases I can sell you it. Then you can add it to your fingerprints (Their PerfectCanvas is very slow and you can get only 30-40 per day, otherwise will need to buy CustomServer).
* [OctoBrowser](https://octobrowser.net/) - €21 for 10 profiles
* [ixBrowser](https://ixbrowser.com/en) - free, but doesn't mask everything, for example, no GPU masking, API by request
* [Gpmlogin](https://gpmloginapp.com/en) - didn't check it yet, pricing is for unlimited use, for 1pc it is $125
* [VektorT13](https://detect.expert/antidetect/) - anti-detect based on virtual machines
* [Wade](https://wade.is/)
* [Camoufox](https://camoufox.com/) - launched via Python, based on Firefox
* [LightPanda](https://lightpanda.io/) - not anti detect, but fast browser for scraping

Useless:
* [AntBrowser](https://antbrowser.pro) - too many lies detected by CreepJS
* [Switch Antidetect](https://switch.mybot.su) - using Chrome 103 while 120 is out. Too slow updates.
* [GhostBrowser](https://ghostbrowser.com/) - only user-agent switch, easily fingerprinted
* [MarketerBrowser](https://www.marketerbrowser.com/) - can't even switch user-agent without detection
  
A bit old [article on how anti-detect browsers can be detected](https://cpa.rip/stati/antidetect-palivo/). Example from the article: `if( Object.getOwnPropertyNames(navigator)[0] ) alert('fake parameters detected');`

# Antidetection tips

Browser - use [separately downloaded](https://incolumitas.com/2021/05/20/avoid-puppeteer-and-playwright-for-scraping/) version of Chrome instead of Chromium, and pass it in `executablePath` in Puppeteer.  
* Screen width/height + Window height/width  - can be emulated by attaching a debugger via Chrome extension, but `screen.availHeight` and width will be wrong. So, it is better to change screen size on a virtual machine or use an anti-detect browser.  
* Disable WebRTC when using proxies/mask public IP: https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6377  
* Match all proper browser headers in the same order
* Autocontext api https://habr.com/ru/companies/globalsign/articles/475586/ https://fb-killa.pro/threads/povyshaem-svoju-anonimnost-putem-kontrolja-nad-audiocontext-fingerprint.2759/#post-19349
* Make sure nothing of your scripts if visible in global score, some websites collect all data (like window.*) and analyze it
* Did you know if you go directly on the website without googling it it will be visible by using window.history.length? 

# What is available in a JS worker:
Worker is another sneaky way to detect real browser data, as you can't modify object properties in it with some extension.
`window`, `screen`, and access to DOM are not available (and therefor canvas)

* Timezone ( `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone` )
* Language ( `navigator.language || navigator.userLanguage` )
* User agent ( `navigator.userAgent` )
* Hardware Concurrency ( `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` )
* [GPU data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerNavigator/gpu) (except Linux & Firefox upd 30.01.2024)
